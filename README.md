# **Revolutionizing Textiles with Robotics: A Glimpse into the Future**  
🤖 *Exploring how automation and AI can transform the textile industry by enhancing safety, efficiency, and sustainability.*

## **Abstract**  
The textile industry in Bangladesh faces **worker safety, environmental, and efficiency challenges**. This study examines the role of **robotics and automation** in addressing these issues. Automation reduces workplace hazards, improves manufacturing precision, and minimizes waste. Data were collected through surveys and analyzed using **SPSS (Chi-Square tests, cross-tabulation, and descriptive statistics)**. The results highlight:  
✅ **Younger generations (18-25) strongly support automation** (P<0.000).  
✅ **Familiarity with robotics correlates with positive views on sustainability** (P<0.000).  
✅ **Automation enhances workplace safety, efficiency, and environmental impact reduction**.  
✅ **AI-driven optimization further boosts sustainability and decision-making**.  
By adopting automation, the **Bangladesh textile industry** can lead globally in **sustainability and efficiency**.

## **Key Findings**  
- 📌 **Robotics reduces workplace injuries & improves worker safety**.
